            "questionId": 3,
            "question": "How should I dress for poleclass?",
            "answer": "It depends on which class you’re taking but in general you should dress in a way that you feel comfortable and can move freely. For the warm up you can have long sleeves but for the pole you need as much skincontact as possible with the pole to prevent sliding, we recommend a sports bra and shorts. If you prefer long sleeved pants we recommend sticky pole pants. We work out without shoes, except for exotic pole."
